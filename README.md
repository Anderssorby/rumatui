Work In Progress. A Matrix client written using [tui.rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) and [matrix-rust-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) to provide a clickable cli to chat.

This project is still very much a work in progress. Please file issues, but I will preemptively say the error messages need work, and the code needs to be refactored to be a little more reader-friendly. Thanks for giving it a go!
